Subject:  Data evaluation for files for receipts, users, and brands

Hi {stakeholder name},

        I did an evaluation of the data in the files I received on receipts, users, and brands.  The data came to me in an unstructured format and my initial
concern was to try to determine inter-retlationships between the files and see if the data could be connected.  If the data cannot be reliably linked we won't
be able to utilize the data from all of the files.  For example, if we cannot reliably link the brand file to the receipt file, we will not be able to use
attributes like brand category or top brand flag when evaluating the receipts.  
        I loaded the files into a database and tried to link the receipts/receipt items file to both the brands and users files, by joining the tables on what
I perceived to be potential keys.  My analysis did determine that we have do not have a reliable link between the brands and receipts table.  The receipt item
lists are at the item level and have a bar code and brand code associated with them which appeared to be the best way to link the files.  These did not reliably
match; one such case is Ben and Jerry's.  It is represented as "BEN AND JERRYS" in the receipts file and as "BEN & JERRY'S" in the brand file.  We need to determine
if these files are inaccurate or corrupted in some manner, and, if not, either need to determine a reliable link between this data (potentially through another
file), cleanse the data, or disregard the brand data in any evaluation of the scanned receipt data.
        I will be contacting the source of the files to determine next steps for resolving the file linkage issues.
        
                            Thanks,
                            Steve Andres
